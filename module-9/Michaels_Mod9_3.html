        Hi, my name is Trevor Michaels. My hometown is <span id="word1">_________</span>, California. I currently share a home with most of my family.

    <p>I work as a full time cast member for the <span id="word2">_________</span> and am currently working on acquiring my bachelors degree from their college program, Disney Aspire. When I am not working or doing school, I enjoy going to the gym, playing video games, going on bike rides, and partaking in fantasy football. I'm currently obsessed with the video game Baldur's Gate 3, and mock drafting to get ready for the fantasty football season.</p>
    <p>When I socialize with <span id="word3">_________</span>, I like to: play Poker, Dungeons and Dragons, go to the Angel's and Ducks games, watch football and movies, as well as endulge in the occasional concert, or night out at the bar. Things I wish I made more time for in my life include traveling to see the world more often, and scuba diving.</p>
    <p>In my childhood I played many sports, growing up through the earlier years I competed in lacrosse and football, later pursuing only football in high school. Going out of high school I went on to attend <span id="word4">_________</span> and I got my associates degree in Political Science. After the Covid pandemic is when I got my job at Disney and starting working on my Bachelor's Degree.</p>
