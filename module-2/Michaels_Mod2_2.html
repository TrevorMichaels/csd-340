    <h2>Chapter 1: Intro</h2>
    <p class="intro"><span class="sentence">Hi, my name is Trevor Michaels.</span> My hometown is Tustin, California, and I currently share a home with most of my family. I have an older brother, a younger sister, my mother, and my father in my family. We also share the house with our pet cat Loki and dog Annie.</p>
    <p>I work as a full time cast member for the Disneyland Resort and am currently working on acquiring my bachelors degree from their college program, Disney Aspire. When I am not working or doing school, I enjoy going to the gym, playing video games, going on bike rides, and partaking in fantasy football. I'm currently obsessed with the video game Baldur's Gate 3, and mock drafting to get ready for the fantasty football season.</p>
    <p>When I socialize with friends, I like to: play Poker, Dungeons and Dragons, go to the Angel's and Ducks games, watch football and movies, as well as endulge in the occasional concert, or night out at the bar. Things I wish I made more time for in my life include traveling to see the world more often, and scuba diving.</p>
    <p>In my childhood I played many sports, growing up through the earlier years I competed in lacrosse and football, later pursuing only football in high school. Going out of high school I went on to attend Orange Coast College and I got my associates degree in Political Science. After the Covid pandemic is when I got my job at DIsney and starting working on my Bachelor's Degree.</p>
